# PrimeByDigit
- This program lets you to find prime number of a given digit.
- The maximum digit is currently set to 7, but you can send it if you need to find bigger number.
- I tried to make the program is efficient as possible. 
- But, If you want to reduce the execution time more, then you can skip printing the numbers which are not prime, just comment the line and uncomment 'pass'. I have tested that if      you don't print the numbers which are not prime this can reduce the execution time by half. Also don't print line that you don't need.
- You may also remove termcolor module and simply print the required numbers. I used colored text to make it look good.
